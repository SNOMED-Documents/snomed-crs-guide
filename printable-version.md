## What is the SNOMED CT Content Request Service (CRS)?

This tool allows users to request modify or make additions to SNOMED CT.

## How do I get to CRS?

Please go to <https://request.ihtsdotools.org> or <http://snomed.org/crs>, where you will be asked to log in.

## How do I obtain a CRS Account?

Please see, [Accessing CRS](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/SCTCR/Accessing+CRS).

## Is there any quick introduction?

Yes. (_and the screen is purposefully blank for a few minutes.._)

## What type of content requests can I make?

Before making any request, please read the guidance on submitting content -

## How are Requests Prioritized?

All requests are treated as normal priority with the exception of data errors. Where a request points towards a possible error in SNOMED CT, the request will be prioritized for investigation.

## How do I submit a request? 

There are three methods of creating requests for SNOMED Content: [Simple Mode](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/SCTCR/Create+A+Request+in+Simple+Mode), [Direct Mode](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/SCTCR/Create+A+Request+in+Direct+Mode), and [Batch Mode](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/SCTCR/Create+a+Batch+Request). To learn more about these modes and help choosing the correct one see: [Creating Requests](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/SCTCR/Creating+Requests)

## Can I save my Content Request and return to it later for completion?

Users may exit the system for later completion, validation, and submission.

## Can I modify my Request once it is submitted?

As an requestor you can do a number of things on each request -  [Managing Submitted Requests Screen](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/SCTCR/Managing+Submitted+Requests+Screen)

### Request Status Glossary

CRS Status| Description| PreviousSIRS Status  
---|---|---  
**Draft**|  A request that has been started and saved but not yet submitted.| _Draft_  
**New**|  All submissions (excluding draft) are initially assigned a status of New. A preliminary check will be carried out to ensure that the new request falls within the inclusion criteria and scope for the International Edition of SNOMED CT before the request will be progressed.| _New_  
**Accepted**|  Following initial review, each request is assigned to a member of the Content Team. A change to a status of ‘Accepted’ does not mean that the request will be approved for inclusion in SNOMED CT.| _Approved_ _& Accepted In Scope_  
**Under Authoring**|  A member of the Content Team is actively evaluating the request.| _Construction_  
**In Inception**|  Where a new request aligns with an ongoing content project, the request will be placed into this status until editorial policy is available to support the requested change or addition. Content projects are intended to investigate issues or enhancements to both existing and future content for SNOMED CT. A process for understanding the problem and elaboration of a solution is undertaken in order to make improvements to existing content and clarify how content of a similar nature will be incorporated into SNOMED CT in the future. Depending upon the nature of the content project, this may be a longterm large-scale content project or a smaller project with a shorter timescale.| _Awaiting policy_  
**Clarification Needed**|  Where insufficient information is provided to proceed with a request, a member of the Content Team will incorporate questions to be resolved and change the status of the request to ‘Clarification Needed’. This will generate an email to the original requester. Where a request for clarification to a customer is not answered within **60 days** from the date the clarification is generated, the request will be marked as rejected.| _Clarification requested_  
**Forwarded**|  Where a request is received that is not in scope for the International Edition of SNOMED CT, it may be suitable for a specific extension. The request may be marked as forwarded to denote that it has been handed over to another extension manager or National Release Center.| _Forwarded_  
**Withdrawn**|  Once submitted, a request cannot be deleted but can be "Withdrawn" by the original requestor.| _Withdrawn_  
**In Appeal**|  Where a request has been “Not Accepted”, the submitter may request a further review of the decision. The submitter can then place the request in “In Appeal” status. In these circumstances the decision will be reviewed and if necessary referred to the Head of Terminology for final disposition.| _Appeal_  
**Appeal Rejected**|  After conclusion of the appropriate appeal process, where the outcome remains unchanged, this status will be applied.| _Appeal Rejected_  
**Rejected**|  Where a request has had a full review and is not considered to be in scope for SNOMED CT, or does not meet the criteria outlined in the Editorial Guide, or clarification about the request has not been received within 60 days it will be rejected.| _Rejected_  
**Ready For Release**|  The requested change has been made and approved, however this status does not assure that the requested change will be included in the final release data.| _Construction_  
**Completed**|  A request status will be changed to "Completed" once the SNOMED CT International Edition, in which the request has been addressed, has been released.| _Completed_

  * Distinguish between active and inactive concepts in a set of search results
  * View more details about a concept in a set of search results
  * Add concepts from a set of search results to a saved list for future use
  * You can use wildcards in the search term to find partial matches. Asterisk ( * ) matches all subsequent characters regardless of word length. Question mark ( ? ) matches a single character. For example:

punc* would find all words stemmed with "punc" eg punch, punched, punctum, puncture etc  
punc? would find punch  
punc??? would find punched and punctum  
punc?u? would find punctum but not punched

## Search by Concept Id and drag and drop to fields in a request

Steps| Reference  
---|---  
If desired a single concept id can be used to locate a specific concept. This is useful for newly created concepts.Concepts from search can be dragged and dropped by selecting the concept by pressing and holding on the FSN.The UI will then highlight the areas that are "drop zones" (A) | <figure><img src="images/31033168.jpg" alt="" title=""></figure>  
Drag the concept to the desired form field and let go to populate the field with this concept. | <figure><img src="images/31033171.jpg" alt="" title=""></figure>  
  
## View search results by matching terms or grouped by concept

Steps| Reference  
---|---  
From the search tab, you may type a query into the search field and the search widget will begin to locate results. You can toggle your results view between matching terms or grouped by concept by selecting the checkbox next to the search field. | <figure><img src="images/31033183.jpg" alt="" title=""></figure>  
View Matching TermsThis search query returns all cases of a query. Eg. If i search for __Diabetes mellitus excluded__ I may recieved 2 search results for this concept since my word "_diabetes_ " is used three times when defining this concept.| <figure><img src="images/31033183.jpg" alt="" title=""></figure>  
Grouped By ConceptFor this same search query, if I select Grouped By Concept, I will only receive one search result for each concept, narrowing my search result to one. | <figure><img src="images/31033183.jpg" alt="" title=""></figure>  
  
## Distinguish and filter between active, inactive, primitive and fully defined concepts in a set of search results

  * In a set of search results a primitive concept is identified by a 

<figure><img src="images/31033159.png" alt="" title=""><figcaption><p>Primitive icon and a fully defined concept is identified by a</p></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="images/31033160.png" alt="" title=""><figcaption><p>Fully Defined icon.</p></figcaption></figure>

  * In a set of search results an inactive concept is identified by a

<figure><img src="images/31033160.png" alt="" title=""><figcaption><p>icon within the concept that you wish to display the details of and a modal will appear.</p></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="images/31033188.jpg" alt="" title=""></figure>

### Add Concepts From Search Results to the Saved List

If you want to save a concept into the Saved List from the search results, you can click the 'add' button

<figure><img src="images/31033165.png" alt="" title=""><figcaption><p>to add the concept into the Saved List. After the concept is added, the 'add' button is disabled</p></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="images/31033190.jpg" alt="" title=""><figcaption><p>, so you can't add the same concept into the Saved List twice.</p></figcaption></figure>

### Viewing a concept in the taxonomy within CRS and use it in a drag and drop scenario 

From various components of the CRS tool a 

<figure><img src="images/31033152.png" alt="" title=""><figcaption><p>View in Taxonomy button can be used to show a concept's position in the taxonomy. Selecting the View in Taxonomy button will load the concept in the Taxonomy pane.</p></figcaption></figure>

Note: only one concept can be viewed at a time and selecting a different concept will replace the Taxonomy tree with that of the newly selected concept.

<figure><img src="images/31033192.jpg" alt="" title=""><figcaption><p>Concepts from search can be dragged and dropped by selecting the concept by pressing and holding on the FSN.</p></figcaption></figure>

The UI will then highlight the areas that are "drop zones"

Drag the concept to the desired form field and let go to populate the field with this concept.

### Using Type Ahead to Locate Concepts or Relationships 

Steps| Reference  
---|---  
Within CRS there may be times where you need to enter in a Concept or Relationship manually. The system will attempt to guess the concept you are looking for by using typeahead. To use, simply enter more then 3 characters to begin searching. Narrow the search results by entering more characters. | <figure><img src="images/31033206.jpg" alt="" title=""></figure>  
This is also applicable for concepts and relationships in Direct Mode| <figure><img src="images/31033210.jpg" alt="" title=""><figcaption><p>Please refer to PDF document [<em>Customer Guidance for Requesting Changes to SNOMED CT</em> , Section 7 Request Status](https://www.snomed.org/<em>files/ugd/900274</em>0588ebe7d1d343158d2ffd52b08d3817.pdf).</p></figcaption></figure>

Topic| What category the request falls under _\- required_  
Summary| Usually the FSN that is the subject of the request  _\- required_  
  
Proposed Use Case| It is very important to incorporate a clear use case for any change request for the International Edition of SNOMED CT. For example “Used as a member of a value set in support of the provider occupation field.” This level of detail will assist the Content Team in understanding the nature and context of the requirement. The justification will also aid in assessing the risks and benefits that are associated with making the change. Please remember that change requests that are country specific are not suitable for the International Edition. This type of change request will not be accepted. Please note that Justification is a mandatory field when making a submission. Copy and paste of generic text such as “gap in terminology” does not supply adequate justification for a change and may result in further clarification (which will delay the inclusion of the request) or a status change to “Not accepted.”  
Semantic Tag|  It is important to consider where the requested concept will sit within the SNOMED CT hierarchy. The requester must take into account the nature of their requirement along with how it will be implemented in clinical systems. When making a request for a new concept the desired semantic tag for the new addition is required as part of the submission. This will assist the Content Team in understanding the nature of the requirement and also help in ensuring that the original requirements are met. The requester should verify that the requested semantic tag aligns with the requested parent term. For example a request for a new concept in the finding hierarchy must be a descendant of the concept 404684003|Clinical finding (finding). Further information about the semantic tag can be found in the Editorial Guide: [Fully Specified Name](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCEG/Fully+Specified+Name?src=sidebar)).  
Reference  
| Submissions for a change to the International Edition of SNOMED CT should be supported by at least one reference. The reference can be added to the justification field in the request template. Please remember that requests for change need to be of international relevance and not confined to one member country. The supporting information submitted with the request is required to be recent and from an authoritative source such as a scientific or professional journal, OMIM, PubMed, Orphanet or a professional society. References to Wikipedia are not sufficient. Literature intended for patient education purposes should not be used in support of a request; it frequently includes generalizations that are not always true but may be true in the context of the topic being addressed.  
Notes| Any additional comments desired to be made about the request  
Namespace| When submitted with a request, the extension concept ID will be retained when the concept is added to the International edition of SNOMED CT. Where retention of the extension concept ID is not required the concept ID must NOT be submitted with the request.  
Definition|  Where a new concept is being requested, a text definition that identifies the exact nature of the request must be included. This is especially important where the request is for an obscure disease or a new procedure or is unusual in its nature. Please note that restating the requested descriptions is not considered to be sufficient as a definition.  
  
CRS Status| Description| PreviousSIRS Status  
---|---|---  
**Draft**|  A request that has been started and saved but not yet submitted.| _Draft_  
**New**|  All submissions (excluding draft) are initially assigned a status of New. A preliminary check will be carried out to ensure that the new request falls within the inclusion criteria and scope for the International Edition of SNOMED CT before the request will be progressed.| _New_  
**Accepted**|  Following initial review, each request is assigned to a member of the Content Team. A change to a status of ‘Accepted’ does not mean that the request will be approved for inclusion in SNOMED CT.| _Approved_ _& Accepted In Scope_  
**Under Authoring**|  A member of the Content Team is actively evaluating the request.| _Construction_  
**In Inception**|  Where a new request aligns with an ongoing content project, the request will be placed into this status until editorial policy is available to support the requested change or addition. Content projects are intended to investigate issues or enhancements to both existing and future content for SNOMED CT. A process for understanding the problem and elaboration of a solution is undertaken in order to make improvements to existing content and clarify how content of a similar nature will be incorporated into SNOMED CT in the future. Depending upon the nature of the content project, this may be a longterm large-scale content project or a smaller project with a shorter timescale.| _Awaiting policy_  
**Clarification Needed**|  Where insufficient information is provided to proceed with a request, a member of the Content Team will incorporate questions to be resolved and change the status of the request to ‘Clarification Needed’. This will generate an email to the original requester. Where a request for clarification to a customer is not answered within **60 days** from the date the clarification is generated, the request will be marked as rejected.| _Clarification requested_  
**Forwarded**|  Where a request is received that is not in scope for the International Edition of SNOMED CT, it may be suitable for a specific extension. The request may be marked as forwarded to denote that it has been handed over to another extension manager or National Release Center.| _Forwarded_  
**Withdrawn**|  Once submitted, a request cannot be deleted but can be "Withdrawn" by the original requestor.| _Withdrawn_  
**In Appeal**|  Where a request has been “Not Accepted”, the submitter may request a further review of the decision. The submitter can then place the request in “In Appeal” status. In these circumstances the decision will be reviewed and if necessary referred to the Head of Terminology for final disposition.| _Appeal_  
**Appeal Rejected**|  After conclusion of the appropriate appeal process, where the outcome remains unchanged, this status will be applied.| _Appeal Rejected_  
**Rejected**|  Where a request has had a full review and is not considered to be in scope for SNOMED CT, or does not meet the criteria outlined in the Editorial Guide, or clarification about the request has not been received within 60 days it will be rejected.| _Rejected_  
**Ready For Release**|  The requested change has been made and approved, however this status does not assure that the requested change will be included in the final release data.| _Construction_  
**Completed**|  A request status will be changed to "Completed" once the SNOMED CT International Edition, in which the request has been addressed, has been released.| _Completed_
