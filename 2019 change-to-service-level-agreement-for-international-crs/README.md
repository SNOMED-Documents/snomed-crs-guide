_**1\. Request Commitment**

  *     *       * A minimum total of 1500 separate requests in total submitted on or before the published request closure date for submissions shall be edited to the next release or have an identified content tracker assigned, unless they are marked for clarification, appeal or are rejected or withdrawn - any request not added to the next release will automatically be assigned a high priority for the following release. Do note that this is a minimum number and not a maximum in order to assist in understanding our resource allocations for other work.

_**2\. Request Balance**

  *     *       * SNOMED International also reserves the right to assess the number of submissions made per country per release to create balance of submissions and fairness in equal resolution of requests.  
**  
**

**3\. Requests**

  *     *       * Any one request may not exceed 150 concept additions or changes. No further request batches of the “same type” may be submitted in a single editing cycle in order to circumvent the Bulk submission process. The 150 total may be submitted as a large submission (for example 100 requests) followed by smaller or single submissions, however once the total of 150 has been reached no further requests of the same type will be accepted during that release cycle.
      * Further requests above the 150 total will be marked as rejected (see below for further information). Examples of same type of requests would be: 150+ requests for new concepts all in the same hierarchy (i.e. procedure, body structure, substance etc), 150+ requests for changes to existing content such as new descriptions, modelling changes such as to stated relationships or attributes, concept or description inactivation, changes to descriptions or questions about existing content.  
  

      * Slight overages of the 150 will be considered on a case by case basis for submission and must be approved prior to submission by contacting Maria Braithwaite ([mbr@](mailto:mbr@snomed.org)[snomed.org](http://snomed.org)). Requests must follow the customer guidance documentation and adhere to the following:

a) International Use Case needs to be documented and an explanation of the clinical application must be provided;b) In all cases, clear demonstration that [SNOMED International Editorial Guidelines](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCEG) are adhered to.c) Any request exceeding 150 “of the same” need to be referred to your Customer and Stakeholder Relationship Management Lead prior to entering the request into the CRS system. See Bulk Submission point 4. We will redirect any further submissions that are found to be similar to the Customer Relations Team. Additional submissions can not be divided and submitted to bypass the 150 limit, once the initial 150 have been submitted.  
  
**4\. Bulk Submissions**

  *     *       * Must be submitted to your [Customer & Stakeholder Relationship Representative](https://www.snomed.org/help-center/help-center), they will coordinate the best path for inclusion, either a bulk submission or a Member Priority project, including feedback timeline within available resources and priorities. It is also necessary that the full impact of a bulk change is understood in order to ensure a quality solution is achieved. Prior to implementing any bulk change(s), a thorough analysis of the change(s) requested, including testing to observe impact, including impact to the terminology and clinical implications, may be required. Therefore, Bulk Submission requests, i.e. >150, affecting one or more domains of the hierarchy, must follow the guidelines below:

a) Support a work plan initiative, or editorial mandate to directly progress or provide a value benefit at an international or quality level;b) Desired implementation date if known or estimated if not known;c) International Use Case needs to be demonstrated and an explanation of the clinical application has to be provided;d) In all cases, clear demonstration that [SNOMED International Editorial Guidelines](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCEG) are adhered to.  
Requests submitted after the published request close date for submissions shall be edited for the following release or have an content tracker assigned, unless they are marked for clarification, appeal or are rejected any request not added to the next release will automatically be assigned a high priority for the release after next.| 90%| _No Change_

  * Requests submitted after the published request close date in CRS follow the same SLA agreement. They shall be added to the following release or have an content tracker assigned, unless they are marked for clarification, appeal or are rejected or withdrawn. Any request not added to the next release will automatically be assigned a high priority for the next release and be deducted from the minimum amount of 2500 for that release. This is done to avoid creating a backlog of requests. 

  
All requests marked for clarification will remain open for a period of 60 days, after which the request will be closed. Automated reminders will be made available new tooling environment when implemented| 95%| _No Change_

  * All requests marked for clarification will remain open for a period of 60 days, after which the request will be closed and no further action will be taken with that request. Please refer to section 6.7 of the Customer Guidance Documentation for requesting changes to SNOMED CT.
