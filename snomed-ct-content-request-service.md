A new synonym may be added to an existing concept if the request aligns with existing Editorial Guidance and has a clear justification.

* **Add or Modify Parent(s)**

A new parent may be added to an existing concept (or changed) if the request aligns with existing Editorial Guidance and has a clear justification.

* **Add or Modify Description(s)**

A new description may be added to an existing concept (or changed) if the request aligns with existing Editorial Guidance and has a clear justification.

* **Inactivate Concept(s), Description(s), or Relationship(s)**

Concepts or their components may be inactivated if the request aligns with existing Editorial Guidance and has a clear justification.

* **Modify and Create New Relationship(s)**

New relationships or modification to existing concepts may be made if the request aligns with existing Editorial Guidance and has a clear justification.
