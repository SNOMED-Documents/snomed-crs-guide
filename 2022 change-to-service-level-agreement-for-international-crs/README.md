## _**Request Commitment**_

A minimum total of 1500 separate requests of the total submitted on or before the published request closure date for submissions shall be considered for inclusion or have an identified content tracker assigned, unless they are marked for clarification, appeal or are rejected or withdrawn. Requests that are accepted will be considered for inclusion providing that:

  1. The required information as specified in the document ‘Customer Guidance for Requesting Changes to SNOMED CT’ has been supplied with the request.
  2. The request aligns with current editorial guidelines. 
  3. The submitter has not exceeded the maximum of 150 changes of the same type.

Complex requests that impact a large area of content or require additional input from resources other than the manager of the request may exceed this time period. 

##  _**Request Balance**_

SNOMED International reserves the right to assess the number of submissions made per country per release to create balance of submissions and fairness in equal resolution of requests.Any set of requests from the same member country/submitter may not exceed 150 of the same type during a 6 month period. Examples of the same type of requests would be: 150+ requests for new concepts all in the same hierarchy (i.e. procedure, body structure, substance etc), 150+ requests for changes to existing content such as new descriptions, modeling changes such as to stated relationships or attributes, concept or description inactivation, changes to descriptions or questions about existing content.The 150 total may be submitted as a large submission or smaller submissions, however once the total of 150 has been reached no further requests of the same type will be accepted during that 6 month period. Further requests above the 150 total will be marked as rejected.Slight overages of the 150 will be considered on a case by case basis for submission and must be approved prior to submission by contacting Maria Braithwaite (mbr@[snomed.org](http://snomed.org/)). Requests must follow the customer guidance documentation and must:

  * Meet an International use case. 
  * Meet [SNOMED International Editorial Guidelines](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCEG)

Any set of requests exceeding 150 of the same type must be referred to the Customer and Stakeholder Relationship Management lead before being submitted to the CRS system. 

##  _**Bulk Submissions**_

Must be submitted to the [Customer & Stakeholder Relationship Representative](https://www.snomed.org/help-center/help-center), they will coordinate the best path for inclusion, either a bulk submission or a Member Priority project, including feedback timeline within available resources and priorities.   
  
All requests marked for clarification will remain open for a period of 60 days, after which the request will be closed without right to appeal.| 95%| All requests marked for clarification will remain open for a period of 60 days, after which the request will be closed without right to appeal.
