CRS Status| Description| PreviousSIRS Status  
---|---|---  
**Draft**|  A request that has been started and saved but not yet submitted.| _Draft_  
**New**|  All submissions (excluding draft) are initially assigned a status of New. A preliminary check will be carried out to ensure that the new request falls within the inclusion criteria and scope for the International Edition of SNOMED CT before the request will be progressed.| _New_  
**Accepted**|  Following initial review, each request is assigned to a member of the Content Team. A change to a status of ‘Accepted’ does not mean that the request will be approved for inclusion in SNOMED CT.| _Approved_ _& Accepted In Scope_  
**Under Authoring**|  A member of the Content Team is actively evaluating the request.| _Construction_  
**In Inception**|  Where a new request aligns with an ongoing content project, the request will be placed into this status until editorial policy is available to support the requested change or addition. Content projects are intended to investigate issues or enhancements to both existing and future content for SNOMED CT. A process for understanding the problem and elaboration of a solution is undertaken in order to make improvements to existing content and clarify how content of a similar nature will be incorporated into SNOMED CT in the future. Depending upon the nature of the content project, this may be a longterm large-scale content project or a smaller project with a shorter timescale.| _Awaiting policy_  
**Clarification Needed**|  Where insufficient information is provided to proceed with a request, a member of the Content Team will incorporate questions to be resolved and change the status of the request to ‘Clarification Needed’. This will generate an email to the original requester. Where a request for clarification to a customer is not answered within **60 days** from the date the clarification is generated, the request will be marked as rejected.| _Clarification requested_  
**Forwarded**|  Where a request is received that is not in scope for the International Edition of SNOMED CT, it may be suitable for a specific extension. The request may be marked as forwarded to denote that it has been handed over to another extension manager or National Release Center.| _Forwarded_  
**Withdrawn**|  Once submitted, a request cannot be deleted but can be "Withdrawn" by the original requestor.| _Withdrawn_  
**In Appeal**|  Where a request has been “Not Accepted”, the submitter may request a further review of the decision. The submitter can then place the request in “In Appeal” status. In these circumstances the decision will be reviewed and if necessary referred to the Head of Terminology for final disposition.| _Appeal_  
**Appeal Rejected**|  After conclusion of the appropriate appeal process, where the outcome remains unchanged, this status will be applied.| _Appeal Rejected_  
**Rejected**|  Where a request has had a full review and is not considered to be in scope for SNOMED CT, or does not meet the criteria outlined in the Editorial Guide, or clarification about the request has not been received within 60 days it will be rejected.| _Rejected_  
**Ready For Release**|  The requested change has been made and approved, however this status does not assure that the requested change will be included in the final release data.| _Construction_  
**Completed**|  A request status will be changed to "Completed" once the SNOMED CT International Edition, in which the request has been addressed, has been released.| _Completed_
