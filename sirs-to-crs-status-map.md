**In Inception**|  Where a new request aligns with an ongoing content project, the request will be placed into this status until editorial policy is available to support the requested change or addition. Content projects are intended to investigate issues or enhancements to both existing and future content for SNOMED CT. A process for understanding the problem and elaboration of a solution is undertaken in order to make improvements to existing content and clarify how content of a similar nature will be incorporated into SNOMED CT in the future. Depending upon the nature of the content project, this may be a longterm large-scale content project or a smaller project with a shorter timescale.| _Awaiting policy_  
**Clarification Needed**|  Where insufficient information is provided to proceed with a request, a member of the Content Team will incorporate questions to be resolved and change the status of the request to ‘Clarification Needed’. This will generate an email to the original requester. Where a request for clarification to a customer is not answered within **60 days** from the date the clarification is generated, the request will be marked as rejected.| _Clarification requested_
