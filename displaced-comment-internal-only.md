# Displaced Comment (internal only)

From Cathy on front page:

  1. We also have an 'Other' option for request type so suggest a small blurb on types of request that may be submitted using that option. Noting of course that where a predefined request template exists e.g. a new concept that it needs to be used. 

Some examples of 'other' requests: 

  *     * Request for new attributes to be introduced
    * Request for existing attributes to be removed
    * Request for existing Refsets to be amended (new members or changes)
    * Request for enhancement (clean-up) of areas of SNOMED CT
    * Request for changes to the concept model
    * Changes to editorial policy statements
    * Changes to text definitions (e.g. "surgical procedure")
    * Request for Quality initiative to address specific quality issues within the Terminology

~~2\. An explanation of the difference between simple and direct mode's- what they are and what request types you can make using each mode.~~

3\. It might be worth adding something to note you can click on the screenshots in the guide in general to enlarge them

4\. Somewhere in the guide add an explanation on sorting requests e.g. so I can sort by status etc... 

~~**Direct Mode:**~~

~~Add Term Rejected Request to Glossary - Farzaneh~~

There is a step missing at the end of the first line - once submitted the new requests goes firstly to the 'request manager' who looks at all the requests that come in, the request will then be assigned to a terminologist who is a member of the content team and who will manage the request until it reaches completion.  
  
Confusing terms are used here such as 'content manager' and 'internal content manager' please consistently use the word 'terminologist' or 'member of the content team' to denote the person who has been assigned a request for review. The person who manages all of the requests that are submitted could be referred to as the 'request manager'

~~Assume this is moving to the Manager's guide or if for use by NRC's (when they use the tool) noting that this functionality is restricted- so an external requester can not assign requests to an author.~~

Perhaps the terms 'staff' and 'author' should be 'content team' and applied consistently throughout the document ??

  1. The batch template accessed through the link. When you click here the screen you see has cut of the words on the right hand side. While they need to download it to use it, would be good to see the whole page. 
  2. Suggest noting that the instructions for completion of the template are within the document itself.
  3. Help page in the template:
     1. Icon images need to be bigger.
     2. Webcast - just noting we have a reminder for work to be done internally. 
  4. Check the numbering provided on this page. We refer to (2) and (3) in the third box down but I had to look for (2) - in the fifth screen down and (3)... does not appear to exist. 
  5. Sentence above Figure 24- a capital to start it off and the end of the sentence 'detail as shown in the screenshot blow" or something similar- just missing a word or two.
